  <h2>Daytime Training</h2>
  <p>
    The Bruxism Detector uses the principle of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">classical conditioning</a></strong> to teach you to relax your jaw during sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the day, the app will occasionally play a <strong>beep sound</strong> at random times.
	<br><strong>Relax your jaw as soon as you hear it</strong>.
	<br>Over time, this builds an automatic habit: the beep becomes associated with jaw relaxation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At night, the same beep will be used when the device detects a clenching event.
	<br>
	Ideally, your body will respond by relaxing automatically, thanks to your daytime training.
	<br>If clenching continues despite the beep, the <strong>alarm</strong> is triggered in an attempt to wake you up.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can stop the alarm from any ringing device in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Press the <strong>power button</strong> on your phone (if tracking with Android)</li>
      <li>Or press the <strong>physical button</strong> on the Arduino device</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
