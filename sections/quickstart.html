  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Assemble the Device</strong><br>
      Use the <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1251532-bruxism-detector-modular-enclosure" target="_blank">3D printed parts</a>, a buzzer, a button, and some wires. Secure the parts using iron thread—holes are provided near the buzzer and button for this purpose.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Build the Headband & Place Electrodes</strong><br>
      You'll need 3 electrodes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 ground electrode</strong> — place it in the center of your forehead, away from the temples.</li>
        <li><strong>2 signal electrodes</strong> — place them symmetrically near your temples.</li>
      </ul>
	  </br>
      To find the exact muscle location, lightly clench your jaw and feel where the temporalis muscle contracts under your fingers.
	  </br></br>Make sure to:
      <ul>
        <li>Move hair out of the way.</li>
        <li>Use conductive gel or replacement pads—dry pads won't work reliably.</li>
      </ul>
	  </br>
	  Fix everything in place with an elastic band (like the ones for underwear). Make some holes and have the electrodes clip through it.
	  </br>You might want to print a clip in TPU like <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4264338" target="_blank">this one</a> (resize the model appropriately).
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Install the Arduino IDE</strong><br>
      Install the <code>CMSIS-DSP</code> library from the Library Manager.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Get the Arduino Code</strong><br>
      Download the latest <a href="https://github.com/LollosoSi/bruxism-detector/tree/main/Arduino/main" target="_blank">Arduino sketch</a> from the GitHub repository.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Configure Wi-Fi</strong><br>
      Edit the file <code>user/WifiSettings.h</code> with your network credentials, then upload the sketch to the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi using the Arduino IDE.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Install the Android App</strong><br>
      Download the latest release APK from <a href="https://github.com/LollosoSi/bruxism-detector/releases" target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a> and install it on your device.</br> Launch and grant all requested permissions.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Start the System</strong><br>
      Wear the headband, power the device, and <strong>long-press the button for 4 seconds</strong>—you’ll hear a beep sequence to confirm it's streaming the tuning data.</br>Note: this only works during the first 2 minutes of runtime. If it doesn't work, restart the Arduino device.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Tune the Threshold</strong><br>
      The app will automatically detect the signal and enter a tuning screen. Adjust the classification threshold so that it's triggered only during real clenching events. When satisfied, tap <strong>“Awesome”</strong>.
	  </br></br>
	  <strong>Long-press the button for 4 seconds</strong> to disable tuning. If you don't hear any confirmation, restart the Arduino device.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Customize Tags</strong><br>
      Go to the <strong>“Tags”</strong> section of the app to select or add pertinent tracking elements.
    </li>
	</br>
    <li>
      <strong>Done!</strong><br>
      You’re all set to begin tracking your bruxism events!
    </li>
  </ol>
